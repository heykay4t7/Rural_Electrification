## Introduction 
Mapping of Non Electrified Household
This project involves Spotting of Existing Service Transformer and Picking the coordinate of Existing Low Voltage Poles 
And also capturing of Non Electrified Household within 500m Radius of the Existing Transformer, 
Activities also Incluide proposing of New Low Voltage (LV) Poles and Lenth of Condutors for new Customers.

## Methodology
For ease of Data Colection A data Collection Interface App was built Using the Mergin Maps Plugin in QGIS, which
makes the data collection to be done simultaneaouls by Multiple Data Collectors in real time.
As Data are beaign Captured, they automatically sVE DIRECTLY on the Mergin Sever which is Linked with QGIS application.
